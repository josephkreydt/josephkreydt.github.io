<p><p>No longer do we wake up cold,<br />
Beside the beasts and creaking trees.<br />
We rest in peace, tucked in the fold,<br />
Of state-inspected doors with locks and keys.<br />
<br />
Now we are finally safe and free<br />
From wasting time on baking bread<br />
And chasing deer just to be fed.<br />
No need to take a shot or watch them flee.<br />
<br />
Whether he’s alive or dead,<br />
Her gnawing teeth will have their fun,<br />
So put a bullet in his head.<br />
He used to chase, but now he’ll run.<br />
<br />
No longer are we slaves to the sun.<br />
No longer are we slaves to the sons.<br />
No longer are we slaves to The Son.</p>
