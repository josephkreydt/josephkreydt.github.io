With luck, before eternal sleep, I’ll see A mere one hundred beautiful as these, And yet their might and quickness to retreat So drive my heart to cherish such a feat." />

<p><p>With luck, I’ll see October’s spell on trees<br />
A hundred times before eternal sleep,<br />
But beauty now arrests my heart with peace<br />
When, each October, life sings harmony;<br />
<br />
A hundred times to witness fall’s great peak,<br />
When here an oak tree turns to orange leaf,<br />
And overnight a maple turns bright red,<br />
And on the hill an elm is still half green;<br />
<br />
When yesterday the air was full of heat,<br />
And then this morning came with cool relief<br />
And now a rain blows past and then retreats,<br />
And lays upon the leaves a glossy sheet,<br />
<br />
And then a soft scent rises, kind of sweet,<br />
But not like candy sweet,<br />
Sweet like memories of past Octobers,<br />
Sweet like a child who kisses on the cheek;<br />
<br />
Then finally, as one, these beauties meet,<br />
A moment when I see the heavens peak,<br />
A moment when I hear the heavens speak,<br />
A moment that arrests my heart with peace.<br />
<br />
With luck, before eternal sleep, I’ll see<br />
A mere one hundred beautiful as these,<br />
And yet their might and quickness to retreat<br />
So drive my heart to cherish such a feat.</p>
