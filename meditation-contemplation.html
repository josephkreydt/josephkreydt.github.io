<h1>The Difference Between Meditation and Contemplation</h1>
<p><p><em>There is an important difference between meditation and contemplation.</em></p>

<p>Among the many beautiful traditions handed down through the Catholic faith, we have meditation and contemplation. In fact, these processes are traditional to many human cultures. One might call them universal. In recent times, even scientists have adopted and studied the effects of meditation and contemplation.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the two processes are often misunderstood or wrongly defined. Misunderstanding leads to untruth. Untruth is the opposite of Christ who is “the way and <em>the truth</em> and the life.” (John 14:6) The opposite of Christ is the Antichrist, spiritual tragedy, Hell.</p>

<p>If we want to practice meditation and contemplation in truth, then we must know what each one is.</p>

<p>The outcomes of many prayers, rites, and sacramentals, of the Church depend on the practitioner knowing the meaning of and understanding their words. For example, the process for praying Lectio Divina includes a <em>meditation</em> piece and also a <em>contemplation</em> piece. Mixing up the definitions of those two words significantly changes how Lectio Divina is prayed. This could result in further misunderstandings and unexpected outcomes.</p>

<p>For those reasons, I am compelled to define meditation and contemplation, and explain why the definitions I provide are their true definitions.</p>

<h2 id="many-popular-websites-and-blogs-present-the-wrong-definitions-of-meditation-and-contemplation-a-few-get-them-right">Many popular websites and blogs present the wrong definitions of meditation and contemplation. A few get them right.</h2>

<p>In a quick web search, from which I simply pulled the top results, I found several incorrect definitions of the words meditation and contemplation.</p>

<p>On <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230303114315/https://mindfulnessbox.com/meditation-vs-contemplation/" target="_blank">mindfulnessbox.com</a>, author Ryan Kane mixes up the definitions of the two words.</p>

<p>He writes, “The main difference between contemplation and meditation is that meditation is a practice that focuses on clearing the mind, while contemplation is a more analytical and reflective practice that involves thinking deeply about a particular topic or concept.”</p>

<p>In truth, contemplation deals with clearing the mind while meditation involves deep thought; just the opposite of what Kane wrote.</p>

<p>We can also see mix-ups and mis-definitions in responses on the popular forums, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/lawofone/comments/17t9o3d/what_is_the_difference_between_meditation_and/" target="_blank">Reddit</a> and <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-prayer-contemplation-and-meditation" target="_blank">Quora</a>.</p>

<p>On Reddit, user <em>greenraylove</em> writes, “Meditation is quieting the brain entirely,” but in truth, meditation involves thought, so the brain is not entirely quiet.</p>

<p>On Quora, user <em>J.</em> writes, “Contemplation is thinking and reflecting with the mind. Meditation is listening.” Again, the two terms are confused.</p>

<p>Sandra Anderson, in an article published on <a href="https://yogainternational.com/article/view/contemplation-vs.-meditation-defining-the-difference/" target="_blank">yogainternational.com</a>, also mixes the two words up. She writes, “While contemplation is a train of thought about something, meditation is training the mind to rest in a particular focus that leads to a connection to the source of consciousness itself.”</p>

<p>In fact, meditation involves thought, seeking to understand. Contemplation involves restful watching, listening. Sandra has written the opposite.</p>

<p>On a Christian spiritual direction website called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231004041350/https://anamchara.com/the-difference-between-meditation-and-contemplation/" target="_blank">anamchara.com</a>, <strong>someone seems to have finally written the truth.</strong></p>

<p>It is there that Carl McColman writes, “this kind of meditation is a process of cognitive, mental engagement,” and “In contemplation, we seek to make ourselves radically available for the presence of God.”</p>

<p>Another truthful answer is given by Sister Mary Colombiere on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231204035027/https://carmelitesistersocd.com/2013/meditation-contemplation/" target="_blank">carmelitesistersocd.com</a>. She writes, “the basic difference between meditation and contemplation is that meditation is a human mode of prayer whereas contemplation is divinely infused prayer.”</p>

<p>I am happy to see that some writers tell the truth. At the same time, the internet is seething with lies. So how do you know I, myself, am not lying or accidentally providing incorrect information?</p>

<h2 id="we-can-find-the-true-meanings-of-the-words-by-tracing-them-back-to-their-roots">We can find the true meanings of the words by tracing them back to their roots.</h2>

<p>If you’re thinking, “who is this guy to say which definition is true and which one is false?” That is a valid concern. Why should you trust me? What is the source of my information? How do I know which definition is right and which one is wrong?</p>

<p>Here’s how I came to the true definitions of contemplation and meditation: I researched the etymology of the two words. In the etymology, we trace words back to their roots. By looking at their roots, we can often determine their true definition.</p>

<p>This is especially true when it comes words like meditation and contemplation which a) have roots in Latin, and b) are used in instructions that were also originally written in Latin, like those of Lectio Divina. By understanding what the word means in Latin, we can understand what the author, writing in Latin, meant when he used the word.</p>

<h3 id="the-etymology-indicates-that-meditation-involves-thought-while-contemplation-involves-observation">The etymology indicates that meditation involves thought while contemplation involves observation.</h3>

<p>Meditation comes from the Latin word meditationem. Meditationem is defined at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240204131931/https://www.etymonline.com/word/meditation" target="_blank">etymonline.com</a> as “a thinking over, meditation,” “to meditate, think over, reflect, consider,” and “take appropriate measures.”</p>

<p>In the etymology, we see that <strong><em>meditation involves thought.</em></strong></p>

<p>Contemplation comes from the Latin word contemplationem. Contemplationem is defined at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231223205157/https://www.etymonline.com/word/contemplation#etymonline_v_18269" target="_blank">etymonline.com</a> as the “act of looking at,” “to gaze attentively, observe; consider, contemplate,” and “to mark out a space for observation.”</p>

<p>In the etymology, we see that <strong><em>contemplation involves observation.</em></strong></p>

<h2 id="proper-definition-and-understanding-of-the-words-we-use-are-essential">Proper definition and understanding of the words we use are essential.</h2>

<p>Mixing the definitions of words, or not taking care to properly understand them, can lead well-meaning people to misguide themselves and others. Who knows what destructive effects result from such misunderstanding.</p>

<p>Hopefully, to any of us who sincerely seek truth and understanding, the Lord will meet us where our knowledge falls short. Nonetheless, faith alone will not suffice.</p>

<p>If we do not understand the words of Christ and his bride, the Church, then the words don’t matter. I can read that “love is patient” a million times, but if I do not understand the meaning of the word patient, then I am at risk of misunderstanding love altogether.</p>

<p>The writings of Scripture were given to us because they matter. The writings of the desert fathers have been handed down for hundreds of years because they matter.</p>

<p>Words matter, and so I will leave you with the words (shared on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220330013657/https://www.thomasmertonnyc.org/about-merton/explore/2016/7/5/the-contemplative" target="_blank">thomasmertonnyc.org</a>) of the renowned and beloved Trappist monk, mystic, and author, Thomas Merton, who knew the true definitions of contemplation and meditation.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>”Contemplation is the highest expression of man’s intellectual and spiritual life…It is spiritual wonder. It is spontaneous awe at the sacredness of life, of being. It is a vivid realization of the fact that life and being in us proceed from an invisible, transcendent and infinitely abundant source. Contemplation is, above all, awareness of the reality of that source.”</p>

  <p>”To meditate is to exercise the mind in serious reflection.”</p>
</blockquote>
